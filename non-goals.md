# Non-Goals of the Agent Authority Protocol (AAP)

This document outlines what AAP explicitly does **not** attempt to solve.

AAP is intentionally narrow in scope.
Its strength lies in clarity, not completeness.

---

## AAP Is Not an Agent Communication Protocol

AAP does not define:

* How agents communicate with each other
* Message formats between agents
* Task coordination or negotiation mechanisms

AAP operates *above* communication layers.

---

## AAP Is Not an AI Alignment Framework

AAP does not attempt to:

* Align agent values
* Control agent intent
* Guarantee ethical behavior

AAP assumes that **intent is insufficient** as a control mechanism.

---

## AAP Is Not a Code Quality System

AAP does not:

* Review code style
* Enforce best practices
* Guarantee correctness

These concerns belong to CI/CD and testing systems.

---

## AAP Is Not a Developer Productivity Tool

AAP does not aim to:

* Speed up development
* Reduce human involvement to zero
* Replace engineers

AAP prioritizes **governability over velocity**.

---

## AAP Is Not a Compliance Checklist

AAP does not provide:

* Predefined regulatory mappings
* Automated legal compliance guarantees
* Jurisdiction-specific policies

However, AAP enables **auditability** required by compliance systems.

---

## AAP Is Not a Replacement for CI/CD

AAP complements, but does not replace:

* Build pipelines
* Test runners
* Deployment automation

AAP governs *authorization*, not execution.

---

## AAP Does Not Eliminate Human Responsibility

AAP does not:

* Remove accountability
* Obscure decision ownership
* Allow “the system” to decide

Every authorized world-state transition has a human owner.

---

## AAP Is Not Opinionated About Tools

AAP does not mandate:

* Specific agent frameworks
* Programming languages
* Infrastructure platforms

Only the authority model is normative.

---

## AAP Does Not Guarantee Safety

AAP cannot guarantee:

* Bug-free systems
* Zero incidents
* Perfect outcomes

AAP guarantees **explicit authority and traceability**, not perfection.

---

# Why These Non-Goals Matter

AAP exists to answer a single question:

> **Who has the authority to let intelligent systems change the world?**

Anything that does not directly serve this question is intentionally excluded.

---

# Stability of Non-Goals

The non-goals defined in this document are considered **foundational**.

Future extensions to AAP MUST NOT violate these constraints.
